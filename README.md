Smart EV Charge Monitoring System

A Smart EV Charge Monitoring System is an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based solution designed to efficiently monitor, control, and optimize the charging process of electric vehicles (EVs). With the rapid growth of EV adoption, there is a strong need for intelligent charging infrastructure that ensures safety, reliability, and sustainable energy management.

This system continuously monitors key parameters such as charging voltage, current, power consumption, energy usage, and battery state of charge (SoC). By leveraging IoT sensors and controllers, the data is collected in real time and transmitted to a cloud platform or local server. Users can then access this information through a web dashboard or mobile application, allowing them to remotely track charging status, analyze performance, and detect anomalies.

Key features include:

Real-Time Monitoring – Tracks charging parameters, battery health, and power consumption.

Data Analytics & Visualization – Provides detailed insights through graphs, logs, and reports for performance analysis.

Remote Access & Control – Enables users to start, stop, or schedule charging sessions via a connected platform.

Safety & Fault Detection – Detects overvoltage, overcurrent, or abnormal heating and takes corrective action.

Energy Optimization – Supports smart scheduling to utilize off-peak hours, renewable energy sources, or load balancing to reduce costs and grid stress.

Scalability – Can be integrated into public charging stations, residential setups, or industrial fleets.

By integrating IIoT technologies, the Smart EV Charge Monitoring System not only improves user convenience but also contributes to energy efficiency and sustainability. For industries and urban infrastructures, it offers predictive maintenance, better resource allocation, and compliance with green energy initiatives.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how IIoT can transform EV charging infrastructure into an intelligent, connected, and sustainable ecosystem, paving the way for smarter transportation and reduced carbon footprints.
